# Attack Dreams — Creative Synthetic Cyber Attack Generator

This repository contains the code for **Attack Dreams**, a creative AI experiment built for the Maximally Vibe-a-thon.

Attack Dreams uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to **generate fictional cyber attack scenarios** as synthetic data, then visualizes them in an expressive dashboard. The goal is to explore *how invisible digital threats feel*, rather than to deliver production security tooling.

This project was refined during the 48-hour hackathon, and the focus is on experimentation, visualization, and creative coding.

## How it works

- A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns abstract patterns from structured network-style data.
- New synthetic samples are generated by sampling the VAE’s latent space.
- A Streamlit interface displays these samples as imagined attack scenarios.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neeti26/VAE-Powered-Synthetic-Data-Generator
   cd VAE-Powered-Synthetic-Data-Generator
   
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the backend (FastAPI):

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

Start the frontend (Streamlit):

streamlit run app.py
